### Projects  
#### ONFANT
ONFANT, ON-FArm Nitrogen Trials, is a web-based interactive tool to visualize and summarize historical on-farm replicated strip trial data conducted by farmers working with the Iowa Soybean Association (see tab “Replicated strip trials”) and guided corn nitrate survey fields data across the Midwest (see tab “corn stalk N surveys”).
